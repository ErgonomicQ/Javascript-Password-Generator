# Javascript Password Generator

## Description
This is a Javascript Password Generator designed to use uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters arrays to string together a PW 
that is a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 128 characters. Using Arrays, concat, and several booleans confirmations a security phrase is generated for the user. I had intially tried constructing this project using string length variables, and while it functioned, I found the code to be extremely bloated, and decided to use Arrays instead, letting JS do the work for me once, as opposed to every single time I called the variable in a 'for' loop. 

I have added a few other elements to the page, such as alerts informing the user of selection requirements and sending them back through. Improvments I'd like to add later on are better function loops that only return to the appropriate user prompts. 

## Installation

You can run this program through VS Code, or your chosen code editor
## Usage

Afer running the index.HTML in your browser(I use Chrome personally), open up the console with Shift+Ctrl+I and then click the Generate password button. Follow the prompts and check in console to see the magic.
